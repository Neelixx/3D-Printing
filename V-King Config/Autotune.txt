http://rigidtalk.com/wiki/index.php?title=PID_tuning

if the temperature is getting too hot before settling down, increase Kd and decrease Kp (more creeping up on the temperature and less muscling it around)
if the temperature tapers off just under the target and never quite reaches it, decrease Kd and increase Ki (less creeping up alongside the target, and more correction for cumulative offset) 

Increasing Ki means that cruising just a hair under the target for a long time will cause Ki to gradually put more power into the heater until it reaches the target. 

A higher Kd would fight this process by decreasing power to get the measured temperature curve parallel to the target temperature line.

if the temperatures are taking a long time to settle, oscillating or hunting indefinitely, decrease Ki and increase Kd (less agitation from cumulative error, and more gliding into alignment with the target); alternatively try decreasing all three terms… the PID equivalent of taking some deep breaths and relaxing the amount of control you're exerting
